# caveman

Caveman is an interactive game where the player goes through an exciting journey in caves. Through the adventure, the player faces various quests that they must overcome. 

Caveman is written in C with integration of the SDL library, consisting of pre-made sprites for images and backgrounds. The character movement and interactions are implemented via creation of custom header files which are used for the main.c file.
